# About the Comic

*FaaS and Furious*, a lighthearted look at life in the cloud, began in 2015 as an irregular creative outlet at [forrestbrazeal.com](https://forrestbrazeal.com). It is now published weekly (with occasional special features) by [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru).

You are free to share these cartoons on social media, use them in slide decks, or even paper your entire office with them, as long as the author is credited.
