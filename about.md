# About the Comic

*FaaS and Furious* is a lighthearted look at life in the cloud that began in 2015 as an irregular creative outlet on Forrest Brazeal's personal blog. It is now published weekly (with occasional special features) by [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru).

You are free to share these cartoons on social media, use them in slide decks, or even paper your entire office with them, as long as the author is credited.
